		<h1><u>About:</u></h1>

	<p>In my previous role in recruitment, I had the BEST looking ads on Craigslist. Using Craigslists simple HTML interface, I was able to create some great, professional looking ads attracting thousands of applicants for each of the positions I was recruiting for. It became one of the most enjoyable aspects of my job. That's when I decided to take the leap and turn the small HTML skills I had learned, and turn them into a career.</p>

	<p>I did a lot of self-teaching for several months, and realized that coding was a true passion of mine. The ability to have an idea and a vision, and turn it into a reality was an amazing feeling. In order to progress my skills quicker I attended New York Code + Design Academy. I am now proficient in HTML, SCSS, javaScript, jQuery, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, in addition to other languages. I have worked both on my and own and collaboratively to create web apps, various sites, and video games.</p>

	<p>Most recently I taught myself the JS library Phaser in order to build a video game which utilizes "bullet-time" and defenestration. I also created a web app which utilizes the Uber and Lyft APIs, in order to tell you which would offer you a cheaper ride to your destination.</p>

	<p>With 6 years experience in Account/Project Management, I have a great ability to multi-task and handle whatever is thrown at me. I love to code. Now I'm looking for an opportunity to combine the two.</p>
